# Summary

Species interactions are a double-edged sword [@gilarranz2017]: those connections that are so vital to the existence of the complex ecological communities that inspired Darwin’s famous “*tangled bank*” metaphor are also those that allow the cumulative effects of climate change and human activities to indirectly spread through communities [@estes1974; @paine1980; @wootton2002; @bascompte2009a; @estes2011]. Still, species interactions remain conspicuously absent from the environmental management literature [@kollmann2016; @heinen2020]. Here, we assess the cumulative effects of global change and human activities on the species of the St. Lawrence System in eastern Canada using a novel network-scale approach that explicitly considers the underlying web of interactions structuring communities. We compare our novel approach to a conventional species-scale assessment to expose transgressive properties arising from species interactions and uncover cumulative effects to species that would otherwise be overlooked. Fishes and marine mammals in particular are prone to indirect effects from all types of stressors; this contrasts considerably with the limited number of stressors affecting them directly. Our approach is, to our knowledge, the first ecosystem based approach relevant to the management of exploited and endangered species which can evaluate the less obvious yet no less significant trophically-mediated effects arising from species interactions in a multiple stressors framework.

# Main

With demands for natural resources increasing with populations [@fao2017], and the effects of climate change intensifying [@ipcc2019], ecosystems worldwide are increasingly burdened with the cumulative effects of a vast array of stressors [@halpern2015a; @halpern2019]. For example, coral reefs face a suite of stressors including fishing, warming temperatures, ocean acidification, and water pollution [@mcclanahan2014a; @harborne2017]. While the magnitude and nature of the direct effects of stressors on species depend on species-specific sensitivities [@oppenheimer2015], stressors can also indirectly ripple through entire ecological communities because of the organization of life as networks of interacting species [@estes1974; @paine1980; @wootton2002; @bascompte2009a; @estes2011]. This is particularly significant considering that indirect effects may be as significant as, and propagate faster than, direct effects [@wootton2002; @menge1995]. The propagation of the effects of stressors depends on the number, configuration and strength of the interactions structuring a community [@wootton2002; @montoya2009]; stressors can modify these structural properties and rewire -- that is, reconfigure -- entire communities and alter the flow of energy in the system [@blanchard2015; @kortsch2015; @bartley2019]. Properly evaluating the net effects of stressors on species should therefore consider species-specific sensitivities, trophically-mediated indirect effects and the structure of local communities [@beauchesne2020b]. Management actions considering community structure and species interactions can lead to efficient and cost-effective outcomes, such as the restoration of kelp forests through the recovery of sea otters (*Enhydra lutris*), an important keystone species [*sensu* @power1996] on the Pacific Coast of North America [@estes1974; @estes2010].

These observations stimulate a growing demand for the management of the structural properties of whole communities to preserve ecosystems [@mccann2007; @tylianakis2010; @mcdonald-madden2016; @heinen2020] and for a broader application of regional cumulative effects assessments [@jones2016; @hodgson2019], which are integral components of an ecosystem-based approach to environmental management [@christensen1996]. Yet environmental management still overwhelmingly operates in silos, focusing on single-stressor and single-species assessments [@hodgson2019; @obrien2019]. Quantitative methods to assess and map the cumulative effects of stressors were developed to address this issue [@halpern2008a; @maxwell2013] and used extensively in marine ecosystems [@halpern2015; @halpern2019; @trew2019]. However, these methods assume that the ecological units on which cumulative effects are assessed, such as habitats [@halpern2019] or species [@maxwell2013; @trew2019], are independent. Applied to species, these approaches capture species-specific responses to the cumulative effects of stressors, *i.e.* their direct effect; yet they ignore the complexities of the processes governing ecosystem dynamics [@halpern2013; @giakoumi2015; @hodgson2019], including trophically-mediated indirect effects and community structure.

Here, we expand conventional cumulative effects assessment approaches [@halpern2008a; @maxwell2013] with recent progress in theoretical ecology [@stouffer2007; @stouffer2012; @beauchesne2020b] to relax the assumption of independence between species and propose a novel network-scale assessment of cumulative effects. We focus on sub-networks of species interactions called motifs [*sensu* @milo2002] to assess cumulative effects. Motifs are subsets of $n$-species that, when put together, construct whole food webs and provide a mesoscale characterization of the structural properties of ecological communities [@bascompte2005; @stouffer2007; @stouffer2010; @stouffer2011; @bramonmora2018]. We then compare our approach to conventional species-scale assessments. Given that effects of stressors can only arise where stressors co-occur with species, and that effects should increase with the number of stressors, their intensity and the number of species, we expect both the species-scale and the network-scale assessments to predict similar distribution of overall cumulative effects. However, we expect the differences between the species-scale and network-scale approaches to reveal how indirect effects refine the assessment, which we refer to as transgressive properties arising from species interactions.

Although our approach is general, we focus our assessment on the St. Lawrence System, in eastern Canada. This system is formed by one of the largest estuaries in the world and a vast interior sea. Together, they host diverse and productive ecological communities [@el-sabh1990a; @savenkoff2000] and provide a wealth of ecosystem services benefiting the Canadian economy: a rich commercial fisheries industry, a seaway that grants access to one of the most densely populated regions in North-America and more than 40 ports, an expanding aquaculture production, and a thriving tourism industry [@beauchesne2016; @schloss2017]. We demonstrate our approach by assessing and mapping the cumulative effects of 18 stressors on 193 taxa between 2010 and 2015 at a 1 $km^2$ scale.  We use data-based or theoretically-derived indicators of the distribution and intensity of stressors [@beauchesne2020], the distribution of species, the metaweb of species interactions, species-specific sensitivities to stressors, and species sensitivity to stressors as a function of their trophic position and specific pathways of effects [see Methods; @beauchesne2020b].

## Results

### Network-scale cumulative effects assessment

An overview of the interactions likely to affect a species’ dynamics -- and the propagation of stressors -- can be obtained through the collection of $n$-species motifs in which a species is involved in a food web [@stouffer2012]; we refer to this as a species’ motif census [@beauchesne2020b]. By assessing and summarizing cumulative effects across a species’ motif census, we consider direct effects to the species of interest, trophically-mediated indirect effects arising from effects to species with which the focal species is interacting, and the structure of local communities (see Methods). We then sum the cumulative effects of all species in each 1 $km^2$ grid cell to obtain a community-aggregated assessment of cumulative effects (see Methods). We find that no area of the St. Lawrence System and few taxa are free of cumulative effects (Fig. \ref{ch5-cumul_meta}) and that cumulative effects are greater in areas where multiple stressors co-occur at high relative intensities and converge with diverse local communities (Supplementary figs. \ref{ch5-hist}, \ref{ch5-stressors}, \ref{ch5-metrics}).

As expected, the network-scale and species-scale are strongly correlated (Spearman’s rank correlation $p_s$ = 0.91, P < 0.001; Supplementary fig. \ref{ch5-comp}). The difference between both assessments uncovers transgressive properties arising from species interactions, which we evaluate as the log ratio of a species network-scale assessment over its species-scale assessment; we then sum species transgressive properties for all species in a grid cell to highlight areas where the assessments differ most. We find that the distribution of transgressive properties is similar to that of cumulative effects assessments (network-scale: $p_s$ = 0.99, P < 0.001; species-scale: $p_s$ = 0.89, P < 0.001; Supplementary fig. \ref{ch5-comp}); this suggests that interactions dampen or amplify the relative magnitude of the species-scale approach as a function of the structure of local food webs.

\end{figure}

### Role of interactions for individual species assessments

We explore cumulative effects to individual species ($i$) by summarizing individual assessments regionally as the average cumulative effects ($C_i$) over a species’ predicted distribution ($C_i / km^2$). We find that the network-scale assessment amplifies regional cumulative effects for most species (Fig. \ref{ch5-comparison_regional}). The difference between the species-scale and network-scale assessments is correlated with a species’ mean trophic sensitivity ($p_s$ = 0.85, P < 0.001; Fig. \ref{ch5-comparison_regional}) and mean indirect effects ($p_s$ = 0.95, P < 0.001), which captures transgressive properties arising from species interactions.

There are 3 broad mechanisms by which cumulative effects are amplified through indirect effects. First, a species may be directly and indirectly affected by the same set of stressor(s). For example, groundfish populations -- Atlantic halibut (*Hippoglossus hippoglossus*), American plaice (*Hippoglossoides platessoides*), witch flounder (*Glyptocephalus cynoglossus*), Atlantic cod (*Gadus morhua*), redfish (*Sebastes spp.*), and Greenland halibut (*Reinhardtius hippoglossoides*) -- are generally affected by all stressor types directly and indirectly (Fig \ref{ch5-comparison_regional}; Supplementary fig. \ref{ch5-species}a). The network-scale assessment shows that interactions and local community structure modulate the relative magnitude of the effects across groundfish species distributions. The groundfish populations of the St. Lawrence System collapsed in the early 1990s due to overfishing [@savenkoff2007; @morissette2009] and shifts in trophic structure have been cited as the likely cause for their slow recovery [*e.g.* @jackson2001; @frank2005]. For such species, cumulative effects are likely under- or overestimated when interactions are overlooked.

Second, a species may be indirectly affected by stressors that were not captured by the species-scale assessment. For example, monkfish (*Lophius americanus*), a demersal predator frequently caught as bycatch in St. Lawrence fisheries, is directly affected by fisheries and climate stressors, yet affected by all stressors indirectly; furthermore, the magnitude of indirect effects to monkfish supplants that of direct effects (Fig \ref{ch5-comparison_regional}; Supplementary fig. \ref{ch5-species}b). For such species, a general increase in the magnitude of cumulative effects may be expected and overlooking interactions likely results in underestimating cumulative effects and overlooking stressors whose effects arise solely through indirect pathways.

Third, a species may be indirectly affected by stressors in locations that were not highlighted by species-scale assessments. The beluga whale (*Delphinapterus leucas*), an endangered and emblematic predator population whose high-profile conservation efforts have yielded no apparent recovery, is an eye-catching example in the St. Lawrence System [@plourde2014; @williams2017]. The population is mostly affected directly by marine traffic and coastal stressors along the coast and across vessel tracks. However, the network-scale assessment shows that the beluga population is indirectly affected by all stressor types and highlights areas along the coast that were not captured by the species-scale assessment (Fig \ref{ch5-comparison_regional}; Supplementary fig. \ref{ch5-species}c). This supports recent reports discussing the importance of trophically-mediated effects in the lack of recovery of the beluga population [@plourde2014; @williams2017]. For such species, considering interactions may be most important and the only way to capture all sources of stress and identify areas where management measures are missing.

Taxa along the orange line are those for which the network-scale and species-scale assessments are equal, that is species which have no predicted interaction.}

\end{figure}

### Cumulative effects to taxonomic groups

Taxonomic groups have previously been used to showcase broad-scale ecological trends that can be informative for science and management [@tittensor2010; @kroeker2013; @sydeman2015]; we thus explored cumulative effects among and between taxonomic groups by classifying taxa into 8 groups divided among invertebrates ($n = 5$) and vertebrates ($n = 3$). We find that the contribution of stressors to direct and indirect effects varies between taxonomic groups and that the spatial distribution of their cumulative effects also differs (Fig. \ref{ch5-contribution_group}; Supplementary fig. \ref{ch5-taxo_groups}). Direct effects are greatest on invertebrates, except for arthropods, and dominated by climate and coastal stressors, whereas direct effects to vertebrates are relatively milder and limited to a few stressors -- that is, fisheries for fishes and marine traffic for marine mammals (Fig. \ref{ch5-contribution_group}; Supplementary figs. \ref{ch5-cont_taxo_bar}, \ref{ch5-cont_taxo_box}). Indirect effects, meanwhile, are prevalent across taxa and from all stressor types, yet the relative importance of direct effects, compared to indirect effects, is lower for vertebrates (Fig. \ref{ch5-contribution_group}; Supplementary figs. \ref{ch5-cont_taxo_bar}, \ref{ch5-cont_taxo_box}).

These results reflect broad taxa-specific sensitivities to the effects of stressors. Invertebrates are predominantly benthic species with limited mobility, many of which feed by filtering the water column, have calcified exoskeletons, or both; these traits make them generally more susceptible to the effects of stressors affecting the physico-chemical properties of their environment, and particularly to the effects of climate stressors  [@kroeker2010; @kroeker2013]. Vertebrates, on the other hand, are generally mobile and active species, and thus capable of minimizing their exposure to stressors. Fishes are ectothermic and more susceptible to the effects of physico-chemical variations in their environment when compared to endothermic mammals. Yet both fishes and marine mammals are much less sensitive than invertebrates to climate stressors [@kroeker2010; @sydeman2015]; instead, fishes and marine mammals tend to be most affected by changes operating through trophically-mediated effects [@sydeman2015; @stier2016].

Taxonomic groups for invertebrates and vertebrates are divided at the phyla and classes level, respectively. For each group, the mean contribution per species was used to evaluate stressor contribution to cumulative effects. The contribution can be divided as the direct and indirect contributions of each stressor to the cumulative effects on each taxon. Direct effects are those attributable to the effect of a stressor on a focal species, while indirect effects are the mean effects of stressors spreading through all 3-species interactions a taxon is involved in. The total contribution to cumulative effect is the sum of the direct and indirect contributions.}

## Discussion

In this study, we show that considering species interactions to assess the cumulative effects of climate change and human activities uncovers transgressive properties that would otherwise be overlooked by conventional species-scale assessments. For many species of the St. Lawrence System, our approach reveals that indirect effects outweigh direct effects, uncovers novel sources of stress, or both. For species that are particularly susceptible to indirect effects, like fishes and marine mammals, properly assessing cumulative effects seems achievable solely through the lens of species interactions. Most commercially exploited species and species at risk in the St. Lawrence System fall in that category; this is worrisome, as it suggests that current management plans and recovery strategies may ignore significant threats by overlooking indirect effects. In cases where the mitigation of direct effects are currently insufficient, impractical, or even impossible, considering indirect effects provides a complementary outlook for management actions to mitigate alternate pathways of effects. This is particularly critical in the context of climate change, over which we possess little to no management control locally; still, management plans should be devised with an understanding of the effects of climate change on species [@elliott2011; @brown2013; @dempsey2017].

The approach we propose to evaluate cumulative effects can offer specific guidance for management and conservation by quantitatively predicting the relative magnitude of both direct and indirect effects of all stressors on all species. Our approach can efficiently identify the pathways of effect that pose the greatest risk to a species of interest, or identify early warning signals for species or areas without management plans that are at risk from cumulative effects. Once identified, these pathways of effect could be further investigated empirically through targeted *in situ* sampling, mensurative or manipulative experiments (*sensu* Hulbert 1984), and the empirical findings could help refine the cumulative effects assessment. Fostering such a feedback loop between predictive capabilities and empirical investigations is key to building an adaptive capacity in the context of ecosystem-based management [also see @hodgson2019].

Our approach retains some limitations and assumptions of conventional species-scale cumulative effects assessments [see @halpern2013; @halpern2015a; @hodgson2019], the most important being that species-specific responses to multiple stressors -- that is, how a single species responds to the effects of multiple stressors acting simultaneously -- are assumed linear and additive. However, nonlinear responses and non-additive effects are prevalent in natural systems [@crain2008; @cote2016]. Still, our approach considers the nonlinear dynamics and non-additive effects of multiple stressors arising from a species interactions [see Methods; @beauchesne2020b]. Much of the limitations and assumptions of our approach are representative of a general lack of knowledge and data for the application of holistic environmental approaches. Once available, knowledge and data could be accommodated to improve the individual components that make up the assessment, that is the distribution and intensity of stressors, the distribution of species, the metaweb of species interactions, species-specific sensitivities to stressors, and trophic sensitivities. These individual components are flexible, grounded in theory and data-oriented; the expanding corpus of openly available environmental knowledge and computational capabilities can thus be leveraged to independently and incrementally improve their quality and, in doing so, enhance the quality of cumulative effects assessments.

After decades of accumulated empirical and theoretical knowledge on the significance of trophically-mediated indirect effects [@estes1974; @paine1980; @wootton2002; @estes2011], the importance of species interactions and community structure in understanding the effects of global changes is increasingly recognised: species cannot be considered in a vacuum [@tylianakis2008; @ogorman2009; @gilarranz2016; @gilarranz2017; @ogorman2019; @waller2020; @beauchesne2020b]. Here, we quantitatively show the gains in ecological understanding we can achieve by considering the less obvious yet no less damaging effects of multiple stressors propagating through species interactions. Our results suggest that we should strive to distance ourselves from species-centric approaches in favour of holistic approaches to monitor and preserve biostructures [*sensu* @mccann2007]. Still, few approaches combine holistic capabilities and broad applicability. In pairing theory, environmental management and computational capabilities, our approach offers an accessible perspective and concrete tools to assess the individual and cumulative effects of climate change and human activities on ecological communities. We believe that building such holistic capabilities is currently one of the most important challenges in fulfilling the unkept promise of ecosystem-based management.

# Methods

## General model

Whole food webs can be decomposed into collections of $p$-species interactions called motifs [@milo2002] that provide a mesoscale characterization of the structural properties of ecological networks [@bascompte2005; @stouffer2007; @stouffer2010; @stouffer2011; @bramonmora2018]. In a $n$-species food web ($n \geq p$), the collection of $p$-species motifs ($p \leq n$) in which species $i$ is involved in ($M_i = \{m_{i,1},m_{i,2},...,m_{i,x}\}$) forms its species motif census [$M_i$; @stouffer2012; @beauchesne2020b]. The motif census provides an overview of all the interactions and connected species likely to affect a species’ dynamics. Here, we focus exclusively on the most abundant 3-species motifs in empirical food webs [*i.e.* trophic food chain, omnivory, exploitative and apparent composition; @camacho2007; @stouffer2010] to assess a species motif census, although the general model would be applicable to any $p$-species motifs.

For any 3-species motif $m_{i,x}$ in species $i$’s motif census ($M_i$), we evaluate the net effect of all stressors on the 3 species as the sum of their direct effects on all species involved -- that is, the sum of species-specific responses $S_{m_{i,x}}$ -- as in @halpern2008a:

$$S_{m_{i,x}} = \sum_{k=1}^3 \sum_j D_j * \mu_{k,j} \text{,} \label{eq1} \tag{5.1}$$

where $k$ are the 3 species involved in motif $m_{i,x}$, $D_j$ is the standardized intensity of stressor $j$ (scaled between 0 and 1; see Stressors data) and $\mu_{k,j}$ is the relative species-specific sensitivity of species $k$ to stressor $j$ (range between 0 and 1; see Specie-specific sensitivity). The relative contribution of stressors to direct effects are those that affect focal species $i$, whereas the relative contribution to indirect effects are those that affect the species interacting with species $i$ in $m_{i,x}$.

Here, we wish to explicitly consider that a species' response to stressors depends on its own response as well as the response of species it interacts with. However, if we only considered $S_{m_{i,x}}$ to evaluate cumulative effects, we would assume that all species involved in interaction $m_{i,x}$ respond the same way to the effects of all stressors. We know this to be false. Indeed, a species sensitivity to trophically-mediated effects -- which we refer to as a species' trophic sensitivity ($T_{i,m_{i,x}}$) -- depends on the structure of the community, its trophic position and the specific entry points of stressors in the system [@beauchesne2020b]. We use simulated trophic sensitivities as weighting factors (scaled between 0 and 1) to modulate the effects of stressors to focal species $i$’s given its trophic position and the specific pathways of effects -- *i.e.* the entry points -- through which stressors affect interacting species [see Trophic sensitivity below and @beauchesne2020b for more details]:

$$C_{i,m_{i,x}} = T_{i,m_{i,x}} * S_{m_{i,x}} \text{,} \label{eq2} \tag{5.2}$$

where $C_{i,m_{i,x}}$ is the cumulative effect of all stressors on species $i$ in $m_{i,x}$, and $T_{i,m_{i,x}}$ is the trophic sensitivity of species $i$ to the effects of stressors in $m_{i,x}$. We then summarize cumulative effects on species $i$ by averaging the cumulative effects across a species’ motif census to obtain an unbiased measure of the topological configuration of species interactions [@stouffer2012]:

$$C_{N_{i,x}} = \frac{1}{|M_i|} \sum_{m _{i,x} \in M_i} C_{i,m_{i,x}} \text{,} \label{eq3} \tag{5.3}$$

where $C_{N_i}$ is the network-scale cumulative effects assessment on species $i$ and $|M_i|$ is the number of motifs in the motif census of species $i$. Finally, we summarize over all $n$ species locally to obtain a community-aggregated assessment of network-scale cumulative effects:

$$C_N = \sum_i C_{N_i} \text{,} \label{eq4} \tag{5.4}$$

We do not control for local species richness because we consider that effects of stressors should be considered greater in areas where richness is greater. The full model is thus:

$$C_N = \sum_i \frac{1}{|M_i|} \sum_{m_{i,x} \in M_i} T_{i,m_{i,x}} * \sum_{k=1}^3 \sum_j D_j * \mu_{k,j} \label{eq5} \tag{5.5}$$

## Stressors data

We used the spatial distribution and intensity of 18 stressors available through an open-knowledge platform called *eDrivers* [@beauchesne2020]. Stressors are divided in 4 groups: land-based (*i.e.* inorganic pollution, organic pollution, nutrient input, coastal development, and direct human impact), climate (*i.e.* positive and negative bottom-water and surface-water temperature anomalies, ocean acidification, and hypoxia), fisheries (*i.e.* demersal destructive, demersal non-destructive high-bycatch, demersal non-destructive low-bycatch, pelagic high-bycatch, and pelagic low-bycatch) and marine traffic (*i.e.* shipping and marine pollution; Table \ref{ch5-t-stressors}). Methods to characterize each stressor are described in @beauchesne2020. Stressors with non-normal frequency distributions were log-transformed to avoid underestimating intermediate stressor intensity values [@halpern2019]. All stressors were scaled between 0 and 1 to obtain relative intensities and allow comparisons between stressors. For each stressor, the 99th quantile of intensity distribution was used as the upper bound for scaling to control for extreme values that may or may not be real observations.

## Biotic data

We used data from 4 monitoring programs conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) to obtain a list of taxa with observed occurrences in the St. Lawrence System (Table \ref{ch5-t-biotic}). We included a list of 30 known whale and seal species in the St. Lawrence System and used distribution ranges available from the IUCN Species Red List of Threatened Species for 24 of the 30 marine mammals species [Table \ref{ch5-t-biotic}; @iucn2020]. We curated the list of taxa used for the analyses by grouping and removing taxa based on expert knowledge and bibliographic research. For example, species of the same genus and hard to distinguish were grouped; species that were identified as probable misidentifications or outliers were removed from the data. The curation process yielded 424953 taxa occurrences and 434851 taxa absences for 391 taxa between 2010 and 2015 (Tables \ref{ch5-t-biotic}, \ref{ch5-t-taxa}). The curation process was documented and is available on GitHub (https://github.com/eBiotic/Biotic). All species scientific names were resolved using the `taxize` R package [@chamberlain2013; @chamberlain2019].

## Abiotic data

We used environmental data characterizing the bottom-water and surface-water salinity, temperature, oxygen, primary productivity, pH (surface) and aragonite (bottom) conditions in the St. Lawrence System. We also considered latitude, longitude and depth, for a total of 13 environmental descriptors. The data was accessed through various regional [@dutil2011; @dutil2012; @galbraith2018; @starr2019; @blais2019] and global [@assis2018] environmental monitoring programs and public repositories (Table \ref{ch5-t-abiotic}).

## Traits data

We documented the body composition, the maximal body size, the type of marine environment in which species are found, the feeding mode, the mobility and the phylum (Table \ref{ch5-t-traits}) of all 391 taxa. We extracted traits data from the World Register of Marine Species [WoRMS; @wormseditorialboard2017], FishBase [@froese2019], SeaLifeBase [@palomares2019], the Encyclopedia of Life [@encyclopediaoflife2020] and the Global Biotic Interaction (GloBI) database [@poelen2014; @poelen2019].  We used the `taxize` [@chamberlain2013; @chamberlain2019], `worrms` [@chamberlain2020] and `rfishbase` [@boettiger2012] R packages to extract traits data. Any taxon for which traits were unavailable programmatically were searched manually on the WoRMS and Encyclopedia of Life web portals. We also documented whether a species was targeted by fisheries or caught as bycatch by local fisheries using data from DFO's Fisheries Logbook Program [@dfo2016].

## Data representation

All datasets are presented at a 1 $km^2$ resolution even though some source data had coarser resolutions (Table \ref{ch5-t-stressors}). We resampled and reprojected data when necessary using nearest neighbour estimates, which preserves the values of the source data. By doing so, we assume that the coarser data are evenly distributed across finer-scale cells with which they overlap. We used the NAD83 / Quebec Lambert projection (EPSG: 32198), which is well suited to represent and preserve surface area within our study system.

## Metaweb

We predicted the metaweb of the St. Lawrence System, *i.e.* the network of biotic interactions, using a recommender approach [@beauchesne2016]. Here, we provide a brief overview of the approach, but refer to @beauchesne2016 for more details. The approach consists of a series of logical steps that predict a candidate resource list for each taxon based on empirical data available and the similarity among consumers and resources. It uses the K-nearest neighbour algorithm [KNN; @murphy2012] to predict pairwise interactions given taxonomic and dietary similarity between consumers and resources and is informed by a catalogue of empirically known biotic interactions worldwide [@beauchesne2016]. The interactions catalogue was built using food web data [@brose2005; @kortsch2015; @universityofcanberra2016], predator-prey interactions [@barnes2008] and pairwise interactions from the GloBI database [@poelen2014; @poelen2019]. We limited the compendium to taxa found in marine and coastal ecosystems. Taxa similarity was evaluated from taxonomic classification and sets of consumers or resources using the Tanimoto similarity measure. A weight of 0.5 was given to taxonomy and consumers or resources to consider them simultaneously [@desjardins-proulx2016]. The taxonomy of all taxa considered was accessed and validated from WoRMS [@wormseditorialboard2017] using the `taxize` package [@chamberlain2013; @chamberlain2019]. We included the main phytoplankton and zooplankton taxa found in the St. Lawrence System to predict the metaweb [@morissette2003; @savenkoff2004; @savenkoff2012]; we then grouped predictions under phytoplankton or zooplankton. This yielded a total of 393 taxa ($S$), considering all 391 taxa identified through the biotic data and the addition of phytoplankton and zooplankton. We predicted a metaweb structured by 4880 links ($L$), a link density ($L_{moy} = L/S$) of 12.42 and a connectance ($C = L/S^2$) of 0.03, which is within range of most reported food webs [@dunne2002a].

## Species-specific sensitivity

We evaluated the relative species-species sensitivity of all 391 taxa to each stressor using a trait-matching approach. For each stressor, we identified traits that were known or suspected to influence a species sensitivity to the effects of the stressor (Table \ref{ch5-t-vulnerability}). For example, the feeding strategy of an organism affects its sensitivity to nutrient and metal loading [@ellis2017], whereas its body composition affects its sensitivity to ocean acidification [@kroeker2013]. Traits were categorized to reflect their relative contribution to the sensitivity of a taxa to the effects of a stressor. For example, suspension feeders are generally more affected by nutrients and metals than deposit feeders [@ellis2017], whereas calcifying organisms are more vulnerable to the effects of ocean acidification than non-calcifying organisms [@kroeker2013]. Traits were categorized by giving a weight between 0 and 1 that reflects their relative contribution to the sensitivity of a taxa to a stressor: a weight of 0 represent a trait rendering taxa insensitive to the effects of a stressor, whereas a weight of 1 represents a trait associated with the highest relative sensitivity of a taxon to the effects of the stressor. If a taxon had multiple traits in a single category (*e.g.* crawler and swimmer), the maximal sensitivity weight was retained. This sensitivity assessment was informed by expert knowledge and bibliographic research. Trait-matching rules and relative sensitivity weights for each stressor are available in Table \ref{ch5-t-vulnerability}. The relative sensitivity of each taxon to a stressor was then evaluated as the product of the relative sensitivity weight of all traits associated with taxa sensitivity to the effects of the stressor. For example, the relative sensitivity to ocean acidification was evaluated using environment, mobility, body composition and phylum traits (Table \ref{ch5-t-vulnerability}). This process yielded a relative sensitivity assessment ranging between 0 and 1.

## Taxa distribution

We extrapolated and mapped the distribution of taxa in the St. Lawrence System using the Random Forest ensemble learner [@breiman2001]. We used the default parameters proposed by the `randomForest` R package to classify the presence or absence of taxa: 500 trees and the number of variables in the random subset at each node set to the square root of the number of variables [@liaw2002]. We only considered taxa with at least 50 observations, yielding a total of 169 taxa (Table \ref{ch5-t-taxa}). Each taxon was modeled using all 13 environmental descriptors (Table \ref{ch5-t-abiotic}). We generated pseudo-absences for taxa without absences in the dataset ($n = 5$) by randomly sampling the study area at least 5 km away from observed points; for these taxa, we generated the same number of pseudo-absences as observed occurrences [@barbet-massin2012]. We measured the performance of the models for each taxon using the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and True Skilled Statistics \citep[TSS; Table \ref{ch5-t-taxa}; ][]{allouche2006}. For each taxon, we predicted spatial distribution within the same 1 $km^2$ resolution grid used for stressors. Individual taxa distributions were then smoothed using bisquare kernel smoothing [@dossantos2018] with a 5 km radius to avoid potentially granular distributions that would affect estimations of species co-occurrence. For marine mammals, we used distribution ranges available from the IUCN Species Red List of Threatened Species for 24 species [@iucn2020]. Our dataset includes distribution maps for 193 taxa in the St. Lawrence System. We assumed that phytoplankton and zooplankton species were present throughout the St. Lawrence System since these taxa are missing from our dataset and are required to properly consider trophic dynamics.

## Trophic sensitivity

We provide a brief overview of the approach used by @beauchesne2020b to evaluate a species' sensitivity to multiple stressors given its trophic position, *i.e* its trophic sensitivity. The effects of multiple stressors on the dynamics of the most empirically abundant 3-species motifs -- *i.e.* tri-trophic food chain, omnivory, exploitative competition and apparent competition -- were simulated using Lotka-Volterra models [@gellner2016]. The dynamics of a single species regulated by density-dependent growth was also simulated; this control was included to consider disconnected species in the metaweb, which may arise due to insufficient data or because a species consumes detritus, bacteria or particulate organic matter. It was also used for the species-scale cumulative effects assessment so that disconnected species had the same cumulative effects results in the network-scale and species-scale assessments.

Negative effects of stressors were simulated by modifying combinations of equilibria equation parameters of population resource growth, mortality, attack and conversion rates [*i.e.* up to 9 parameters and 511 distinct pathways of effect; @beauchesne2020b]. Modifications to parameters simulate effects of stressors on ecological processes; these represent the pathways through which stressors directly and indirectly affect ecological communities. The set of all ecological processes affected by stressors across species combine to collectively affect a community and form a pathway of effect. For each 3-species motif, all possible pathways of effects were simulated; this resulted in 127 unique pathways of effect for tri-trophic food chain, exploitative competition and apparent competition motifs through 7 parameters, 511 pathways of effect for the omnivory motif through 9 parameters, and 1 pathway of effect for disconnected species through 1 parameter. For each pathway of effect, a species's trophic sensitivity was defined as the difference in its equilibrium abundance before and after the permanent appearance of stressors in the system; this represents the net effect of stressors on species and integrates all direct and indirect effects propagating to a focal species [@abrams1996; @beauchesne2020b].

Here, due to the challenge of empirically distinguishing effects to specific ecological processes, we simplified pathways of effects and broadly considered effects to a species density rather than effects to specific ecological processes as in @beauchesne2020b. We used trophic sensitivities across possible pathways of effect simulated in @beauchesne2020b as heuristics to assess a species' trophic sensitivity to the effects of stressors given its position in 3-species motifs. We used the absolute values of simulated trophic sensitivities and considered that any effect to a species' population dynamics, whether negative or positive, can propagate and disturb the dynamics of an ecological community. We then simplified pathways of effects as a function of their effects to the density of each species. For example, a pathway of effect targeting the mortality of a consumer was considered to affect the density of that consumer, whereas a pathway of effect targeting the attack rate of a consumer was considered to affect the density of both the consumer and the resource. We averaged trophic sensitivities to pathways of effects according to their contribution to the effects on species density, resulting in 8 possible pathways of effect for all 3-species motifs and 2 pathways of effect for the single species, each with a pathway of effect where no effects are observed. Trophic sensitivities were scaled between 0 and 1 for the analyses.

DFO's annual multidisciplinary research survey is held in August for the Northern Gulf and September for the Southern Gulf [@bourdages2018]. The survey is conducted with a shrimp trawl using a stratified random sampling plan. All fish and invertebrate species caught are identified and measured. Due to the scientific nature of the survey, this is the only dataset from which we considered taxa absences. DFO's Fisheries Logbooks Program was also used to obtain occurrence data on species in the St. Lawrence System [@dfo2016]. Whereas logbooks are not mandatory for all fisheries in the St. Lawrence System, they still provide a thorough overview of the distribution of fishing activities and the presence of species caught. DFO's At-Sea Observers Program stations certified private-sector observers aboard fishing vessels to monitor fishing activities and collect scientific data. DFO's Sentinel Fisheries Program seeks to develop abundance indicators for cod stock assessments in the Northern Gulf by involving the industry in controlled fishing activities. Fixed gear (*i.e.* longlines and gillnets) sampling is conducted on participating fisherman's fishing grounds throughout the fishing season. Mobile gear sampling is conducted using a trawl and a stratified random sampling plan in July. Marine mammals are an important component of the communities of the St. Lawrence System, especially in the Estuary. We included the list of 30 whale and seal species to build the list of taxa and to predict the metaweb (see below). However, we could not consider them for the spatial analyses as occurrence data were inaccessible.

Direct effects are those attributable to the effect of a stressor on a focal species, while indirect effects are the mean effects of stressors spreading through all 3-species interactions a taxa is involved in. The total contribution to cumulative effect is the sum of the direct and indirect contributions. Commercially exploited taxa and endangered, threatened and species of concern under the Canadian species at risk act are identified on the figure next to taxa names. }
